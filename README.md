Cuora is an AI-powered mobile application designed to provide immediate, intelligent support during medical emergencies. The app bridges the critical time gap between the onset of a health crisis and the arrival of professional help by combining real-time location sharing, AI-guided triage, and a community of nearby certified first responders.

With just one tap on the SOS button, Cuora instantly alerts emergency contacts, shares your live location, and dispatches notifications to trained responders in your vicinity. While help is on the way, Cuora’s built-in AI Triage Assistant guides users or bystanders through step-by-step first-aid instructions tailored to the situation — whether it’s a seizure, bleeding, asthma attack, or unconsciousness. The assistant uses natural language prompts to keep communication simple, accessible, and calming.

One of Cuora’s standout features is the Health Passport, a digital medical ID that stores critical information such as allergies, medications, and existing conditions. This data can be securely shared with responders or emergency rooms, ensuring faster and more accurate care.

The Responder Map tracks the estimated time of arrival and profile of the volunteer en route, bringing transparency and reassurance during high-stress moments.

Designed for accessibility, Cuora serves the elderly, individuals with chronic conditions, solo travelers, students, and caregivers. By enabling communities to act as a safety net, the app promotes faster intervention and empowers everyday people to help save lives.

Cuora is built using Flutter, Firebase, and integrates OpenAI for smart triage logic. It's a seamless blend of technology, healthcare, and compassion — redefining what emergency response can look like in the digital age.
