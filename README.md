🩺 Project Title: Cuora – AI-Powered Emergency Health Responder Network
🌟 Overview:
Cuora is a mobile-first emergency response app designed to bridge the critical time gap between a health emergency and professional medical assistance. By combining AI-guided first aid triage, real-time location sharing, and a community responder network, Cuora empowers users to receive help faster and more intelligently — even before an ambulance arrives.

🚀 Key Features:
One-Tap SOS: Instantly alert emergency contacts, share your live location, and activate nearby certified responders.

AI Triage Assistant: Interactive AI chatbot guides the user or a bystander through essential first-aid steps based on the situation.

Responder Locator: Maps and notifies nearby trained volunteers who can respond to the scene quickly.

Health Passport: A digital medical ID that securely stores allergies, medications, conditions, and emergency contacts — accessible via QR code.

Real-Time Status Updates: Track the responder's ETA, name, and actions in progress, ensuring transparency and calm during crises.

💡 Why Cuora Stands Out:
AI-Powered Support: Makes healthcare more accessible during moments of panic, even without medical knowledge.

Community Driven: Crowdsourced network of trained responders fills the response gap in critical moments.

Designed for All: Ideal for seniors, people with chronic conditions, caregivers, and everyday citizens.

Multilingual & Voice Support: Makes lifesaving guidance accessible regardless of literacy or language barriers (planned for future release).

🧠 Tech Stack:
Frontend: Flutter (cross-platform)

Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Real-time DB), FastAPI (AI middleware)

AI/NLP: OpenAI GPT / MedPaLM for triage, Google Maps API for navigation

Security: Biometric lock, encrypted health data, role-based access for responders

📱 Platform:
Android & iOS
🌐 Optional admin dashboard for responder/incident management
